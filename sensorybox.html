                <p>Under the Google UX Design program, I designed an app for social good called Sensorybox. The app helps kids learn about feelings and emotions.</p>

            <h1>User Research Summary</h1>
            <p>I conducted user research on youth with parental consent and received feedback from users that I turned into user personas. One of the user personas, Natalie, is a 10 year old girl in the 5th grade who likes to play outside with friends and enjoys online learning. Research revealed that Natalie is curious about emotions and feelings but does not know where to go to learn more.</p>

            <p>To demonstrate learning about emotions and feelings, I designed a quiz to be as intuitive as possible and easy to navigate for use by kids and youth. For example, the quiz is properly labeled to help the user navigate what to do on each screen and displays one question at a time. The user can then tap a next arrow to view the next question.</p>

            <h1>Research Plan and Usability Study</h1>
            <p>My goal was to understand any difficulties users encountered when trying to complete the quiz. For example, I asked, “Can users select an option, check their answer, and move to the next screen without any prompting?”
                I conducted a moderated usability study in early June and tasked 5 kids, individually, (whose parents provided consent) to take a short quiz about emotions. Each usability study session lasted about 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>Study participants included: 3 girls and 2 boys from the ages of 10 to 13.<br> 
                Finally, I recorded the session and completed a behavioral observation checklist.</p>

            <h1>Usability Study Insights</h1>
            <p>Based on the data from the study, I identified three areas that needed improvement:</p>
            <p>1. Users had some trouble viewing the answer choices as they stated the faces looked too small. Some users moved closer to the screen to view the answer choices. Thus, users need a more magnifying view of the choices.</p>
            <p>2. Users asked if they could skip a question and go back to it later, since they did not know the correct answer at the time. Therefore, users want more control in how they take the quiz.</p>
            <p>3. Users asked how long the quiz was and what question they were currently in. Thus, users want to know the length of the quiz and their place in it.</p>

            <h1>Mockups</h1>
            <p>I added bright colors that would appeal to a younger audience. Next, combined the quiz section into the main learning screen and gave the user a choice to select the learning path or the quiz path of the app. I implemented the feedback I received from the usability test in order to improve the user experience. For example, instead of lining all answer choices in one row, I split the choices into two rows to increase the size of the smiley faces for better viewing. Also, I labeled the number of questions for the quiz. Lastly, I placed a back arrow so users can go back and view their responses or skip ahead and come back to the question later.</p>

        <h1>Accessibility Considerations</h1>
        <p>In order to ensure the app was accessible, I made the font darker for better readability and increased the size of the answer choices. Future usability studies will include users of assistive technologies such as keyboards and screen readers.</p>

        <h1>Learnings and Next Steps</h1>
        <p>I deeply enjoyed completing this final project for the Google UX Design Certificate program because I had a chance to design an app for social good. Moreover, I felt comfortable working with children given my past work/intern experience as a school social worker. Finally, one way to improve the app would be to inquire about the star-reward system and ask participants how that makes them feel. This line of research, I believe, could help inform the designer if the reward system helps improve the user experience. </p>
