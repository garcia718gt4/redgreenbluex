            <p>To demonstrate learning about emotions and feelings, I designed a quiz to be as intuitive as possible and easy to navigate for use by kids and youth. For example, the quiz is properly labeled to help the user navigate what to do on each screen and displays one question at a time. The user can then tap a next arrow to view the next question.</p>

                <h1>Usability Study</h1>
                <p>My goal was to understand any difficulties users encountered when trying to complete the quiz. For example, I asked, “Can users select an option, check their answer, and move to the next screen without any prompting?”
                    I conducted a moderated usability study in early June and tasked 5 kids, individually (whose parents provided consent). Each usability study session lasted about 10 minutes.</p>

                <h1>Study Insights</h1>
                <p>Based on data from the usability study, I identified three areas that needed improvement:</p>
                <p><span class="number">1</span>Users had some trouble viewing the answer choices as they stated the faces looked too small. Some users moved closer to the screen to view the answer choices. Thus, users need a more magnifying view of the choices.</p>
                <p><span class="number"> 2</span> Users asked if they could skip a question and go back to it later, since they did not know the correct answer at the time. Therefore, users want more control in how they take the quiz.</p>
                <p><span class="number">3</span> Users asked how long the quiz was and what question they were currently in. Thus, users want to know the length of the quiz and their place in it.</p>

            <h1>Mockups Summary</h1>
            <p>I added bright colors that would appeal to a younger audience. Next, I combined the quiz section into the main learning screen and gave the user a choice to select the learning or quiz path and implemented the feedback I received from the usability test. For example, instead of lining all answer choices in one row, I split the choices into two rows to increase the size of the smiley faces for better viewing. Also, I labeled the number of questions for the quiz. Lastly, I placed a back arrow so users can go back and view their responses or skip ahead and come back to the question later.</p>

   <div class="accessibility center-vertical"> 
    <div class="text-wrap abstract-container">
        <h1>Accessibility Considerations</h1>
        <p>In order to ensure the app was accessible, I made the font darker for better readability and increased the size of the answer choices. Future usability studies will include users of assistive technologies such as keyboards and screen readers.</p>

<div class="learnings"> 
    <div class="text-wrap abstract-container learnings-info-wrap">
        <h1>Learnings and Next Steps</h1>
        <p>One way to improve the app would be to inquire about the star-reward system and ask participants how that makes them feel. This line of research, I believe, could help inform the designer if the reward system helps improve the user experience. </p>
