        <p>My interest in technology emerged when I bought my first smartphone several years ago. I remember opening several preloaded apps and easily browsing the interface with much amazement. It was an incredible initial experience. At the time, I was applying my psychology degree and working for non-profits helping people, from the ages of school year children to senior adults, with their mental health and behaviroal functioning. Impressed, by the technology in smartphones, I decided to learn the Swift programming language with the goal of building a useful app some day. Along the way, I learned about web development and taught myself front-end skills  using Teamtreehouse(tm) services. This, in turn, lead me to learn about UX design and I discovered a deep passion for it. Finally, the human centered approach I learned in my previous education and field of work in psychology helped me better understand how to design  Today, I continue to further develop my skills in UX design to build incredible online experiences.  </p>
