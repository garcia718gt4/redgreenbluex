            <p>Before I began ideating ideas for a user flow, I first conducted user interviews to understand the people I was designing for. Interviewees included adults between the ages of 21 and 38, and I asked them about their community involvement. The feedback I received from the interviews resulted in a problem statement for a user persona called Madison.</p>

            <h1>Research Plan</h1>
            <p>The main research goal was to understand if participants can easily navigate a user flow. I tested five participants individually in a moderated usability study. The majority of participants were alert and seemed to understand the directions. Each usability study session lasted about 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>Study participants included: <br>  
                <strong>4 </strong>women and<strong> 1 </strong>man with ages ranging from 21 to 38.<br> 
                Finally, I recorded the session and completed a behavioral observation checklist.</p>

        <h1>Study Summary</h1>
        <p>Research revealed most participants were able to comfortably navigate the user flow. However, a common response amongst participants was if the volunteer button could also be found in the navigation bar or be nested in the navigation, as they reported they were familiar with this type of design. The insight that users want multiple ways to enter a user flow was key to creating the mockups. Overall, almost all participants reported they found the study easy and simple to complete.</p>

        <h1>Mockups</h1>
        <p>For the mockups, I incorporated user feedback and added a dropdown menu where the user can select "volunteer" instead of having to scroll down to the volunteer section. I left in place what users found comfortable and easy to use, mainly the large labels and dividers of the webpage. Finally, my goal for the mockup was to design a simple and appealing website that would not take long for a user to fill-out and submit an online registration form.</p>

        <h1>Accessibility Considerations</h1>
        <p>I made use of color contrast to enhance the readability of text against darker background colors. One way to increase the accessibility of the website in future testing is to include people who use switches or other assistive technologies.</p>

        <h1>Learnings</h1>
        <p>This was a fun project to work on. Given that I currently work for a non-profit serving homeless veterans, I took special care in designing how a non-profit website should look and feel. I learned that responsive web design should carry the same feeling of engagement, though not necessarily look, across multiple window or screen sizes.</p>
