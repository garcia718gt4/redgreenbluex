                2. Wireframe the website <br>
                3. Mockup the website.</p>

                    <h3 class="color-title">Color</h3>
                    <p>On the landing page, the colors coral and baby green are complementary - coral is used in the banner and baby green for the frog. These two colors are more prominent than the others on the landing page. However, when scrolling down the page the site appears dull.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col shapes">
                    <h3 class="shapes-title">Shapes</h3>
                    <p>The rectangles help display each t-shirt individually. However, if the website used a few circles or triangular shapes to display featured t-shirts or tank-tops, then the design of the website would break from a heavy rectangular pattern.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col group">
                    <h3 class="grouping-title">Grouping</h3>
                    <p>The elements on the website are grouped by “t-shirts” and “tank-tops.” This grouping clearly distinguishes each style of shirt and makes it easier for the user to browse the t-shirt collection.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col balance">
                    <h3 class="balance-title" >Balance/Organization</h3>
                    <p>The organization is logical, that is, a user selects a t-shirt style, moves to another page where the user can decide on the size, then can proceed to the checkout on a separate page. This design thinking enhances the user experience as the user knows there is a sequential order to making a purchase. </p>

                <p>I think users are interested in a visually appealing website that immediately informs the user what the website is about. Users are happy when they can easily find the best or new products on the site. Today, a lot of users are interested in social media, so linking the company’s social media in the footer lets users view the latest social trends about the company.</p>

On the home page, I included pictures of younger persons who appear casual but in a good mood wearing the brand’s t-shirts. This strategic placement can help draw the targeted audience which are users between the ages of 16-35. Further, a stylish and friendly website without being too spontaneous or quirky can help invite users to engage with the content. In other words, the website’s personality tries to be playful and inclusive with appeasing looking colors, a simple layout, easy navigation, and with a modern style. </p>

                            <p class="color-paragraph">Although I decided to keep the text content minimal for the mockup, I was mindful of the type of text content I used. For example, on the home page, I wanted to clearly describe to the user that the shirts shown in the middle of the page are the new featured t-shirt and tank-top. Moreover, I used more descriptive text on the product details page to help the user learn more about the quality of the t-shirt. As for the catalog page, I included a new feature called “Hop Shop.” Essentially, this feature would work just like a quick shop button. To illustrate, whenever the user hovers over a t-shirt the “Hop Shop” button appears and when clicked, the user could speed up their shopping by adding the item to their bag without going to the product details page.</p>

                <h2 class="approach-title">Redesign Summary</h2>
                <p>The way I approached the redesign of the t-shirt website was to recognize all the essential features of the site and display them in a clear, visible layout. For example, on the home page I included only two images of the featured t-shirts and a section divided by women and men t-shirts. Next, my goal was to make the website appear clean, sophisticated, yet fun and lively thus, I used appeasing looking colors with blends to highlight some major sections. </p>

            <!-- OVERALL SUMMARY -->
            <div class="overall-summary card last-card">
                <h2 class="overall-title">Overall Project Summary</h2>
                <p>I learned that it is important to remain consistent with the overall design theme. In some instances I wanted to use different typographic choices but they did not engender a feeling of fun, playfulness, or welcomness. Also, I learned about color contrast as is evident on the home page where I used analogous colors for the women/men category and complimentary colors dividing the featured t-shirt section and the category section.</p>
                <p>There are a couple of things I would do differently next time. First, I would create several mockups with different color combinations. At one point I was questioning if the colors I used were the “right” colors for this website. Creating different mockups would have helped me feel more confident that these were the correct colors for the site. Second, I would have explored asking other people for their opinion about the website’s overall design, in particular, asking them if the site carries a consistent look or theme.  </p>
